        <h2>The purpose behind this project was to construct a video game with C programming
			to be played on a GameBoy Advance (or GameBoy emulator). I was responsible for
			both the frontend and the backend, though most of the backend was provided as starter
            code. You can view the code via the Github link below. On this page, a short demo
            video of the final gameplay is also included.
