		<h2><a href="citySkate.html">"CitySkate" Game</a></h2>
		<h3>Languages/Software: C</h3>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			The purpose behind this project was to construct a video game with C programming
			to be played on a GameBoy Advance (or GameBoy emulator). I was responsible for
			both the frontend and the backend.

		<h2><a href="mania.html">"Mania at Mt. Muffin" Game</a></h2>
		<h3>Languages/Software: Java, JavaFX, Gradle, Github</h3>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			The purpose behind this project was less so about the actual game
			and more so about working with a team to enact the principles of iterative development
			and the Unified Process. Our team produced several Unified Modeling Diagrams
			to appropriately organize the project.

		<h2><a href="investigation.html">"Investigation" Game</a></h2>
		<h3>Languages/Software: Unity, C#, Maya</h3>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			The purpose of this project was to gain knowledge and experience in 3D
			graphic modeling practices to create an interactive experience. I worked with a team
			where I was responsible for the frontend coding as well as the level designs. As a 
			team we had to constantly think about user interaction and user experience in regard to our project.

		<h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
		<h3>Languages/Software: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h3>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			I constructed this web portfolio from scratch entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
			The intention behind it was to showcase my software projects as well as to demonstrate
			my web development skills. It began as a project for one of my undergrad courses but I
			continued to work on it and refine it as a personal project of my own.

		<h2>Detroit Metropolitan Airport Wifi Landing Page</h2>
		<h3>Languages/Software: HTML, CSS, AI, Figma </h3>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			The client presented me with the old, outdated model of the splash page, to wchich they
			wanted me to come up with a sleeker, more modern version. I tackled this by integrating
			modern design principles including rounded corners, buttons replacing links, and dark mode
			features. I satisfied the clients requirements and the page is now viewed by more than 5,000
			people on a daily basis as they commute through the Detroit Airport.

		<h2><a href="https://sweeps.flyhoustonrewards.com" target="_blank">FlyHouston Rewards Landing Page</a></h2>
		<h3>Languages/Software: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma </h3>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			I was tasked with developing a landing page for a sweepstakes that the Houston Airport
			was conducting. I was given a mockup of the email version and completely redesigned it
			in Figma to present a clean, engaging landing page. The page is entirely responsive across
			devies and includes animated icons, consistent branding, and mobile-first principles;
			all driving user interaction.

		<h2><a href="readARhyme.html">"Read-a-Rhyme" Web Application</a></h2>
		<h3>Languages/Software: React Native, JavaScript, Figma </h3>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			This was a two-semester long team capstone project where my team worked with
			a real client to create a functional product that met the company's requirements.
			The purpose behind this project was to produce software that solves a complex
			problem through the analysis of design tradeoffs, non-functional requirements,
			and real-world customer needs. We incorporated iterative development, design 
			prototyping (via Figma), along with user research.

		<p id="p2">
			My web development projects showcase my professional experience, with the 
			first example being this very portfolio site. The rest include websites 
			and apps that I built/developed as a freelancer or under independent contracts. 
			Naturally these projects were frontend intensive so I was able to refine
			my skills in that regard. Click to view my works.

		<h2 id="IP">Interaction Projects</h2>
		<!-- <h2>Interaction Projects</h2> -->

		<p id="p1">
			As part of my undergrad experience, I created a handful of interactive games;
			all very different from another. Though these projects are a bit juvenille, I gained quite a bit of
			experience in software development (both frontend and backend), user interaction principles,
			and iterative development in a team setting. Click to view my works.
