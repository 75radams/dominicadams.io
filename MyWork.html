		<h2>"CitySkate" Game</h2>
		<h3>Languages/Software: C</h3>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			The purpose behind this project was to construct a video game with C programming
			to be played on a GameBoy Advance (or GameBoy emulator). I was responsible for
			both the frontend and the backend. 
		</p>

		<h2>"Mania at Mt. Muffin" Game</h2>
		<h3>Languages/Software: Java, JavaFX, Gradle, Github</h3>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			The purpose behind this project was less so about the actual game
			and more so about working with a team to enact the principles of iterative development
			and the Unified Process. Our team produced several Unified Modeling Diagrams
			to appropriately organize the project.
		</p>

		<h2>"Investigation" Game</h2>
		<h3>Languages/Software: Unity, C#, Maya</h3>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			The purpose of this project was to gain knowledge and experience in 3D
			graphic modeling practices to create an interactive experience. I worked with a team
			where I was responsible for the frontend coding as well as the level designs. As a 
			team we had to constantly think about user interaction and user experience in regard to our project.

		<p id="p1">
			As part of my undergrad experience, I created a handful of interactive games;
			all very different from another. Through these projects I gained quite a bit of
			experience in software development (both frontend and backend), user interaction principles,
			and iterative development in a team setting. Click to view my works.

		<p id="p2">
			As of right now, I have two web development projects under my belt. One
			being the very web portfolio that you are browsing rigt now and the second
			being a web application that I worked on with a team. Naturally these two
			projects were frontend intensive so I was able to refine my skills in that regard.
