	<section id="Who">
		<h2>Who Is Dominic</h2>
		<p>I am a creative creator, a visual visionary, and a distinctive developer - a digital <i>renaissance man</i>. I designed this portfolio
			as a reflection of all of these characteristics. In December 2023 I recieved my Computational Media
			degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology and it proved nothing short of challenging but I love
			to challenge myself. As you browse my portfolio and view my works I want you to see what I have done, but
			more importantly, what I <i>could</i> do and the challenges we can conquer together.
		</p>

	<section id="CM">
		<h2>Computational Media</h2>
		<p>
			Often times, there is a little bit of ambiguity and confusion from employers/clients
			about what exactly "Computational Media" is, so I would like to elaborate on
			my major a little bit more. Computational media (CM) is a branch of computer science (CS); it is the
			"sister" major to CS here at Georgia Tech. CM is a combination of computer science and design,
			with creative applications such as front end development, user experience/user interaction, and
			game design. Essentially, computer science focuses on backend whereas computational
			media is half backend, half front end with the incorporation of design principles. I
			personally love it because it gives a creative outlet while I can still solve the
			puzzle-like challenges that coding presents.

	<section id="SKILLS">
		<h2>Software Skills</h2>
		<p>
			I have an arsenal of software skills under my belt that I have gained through many
			projects. As far as the explicit skills go, I am adept at several languages such as Java,
			C, HTML, JavaScript, C#, and React. I also have experience/familiarity with Node.js,
			TypeScript, and React Native. In regard to design applications, I am proficient
			with the adobe suite as well as Figma.
