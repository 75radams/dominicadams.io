		<h2>Who Is Dominic</h2>
		<p>I am a creative creator, a visual visionary, and a distinctive developer. I designed this portfolio
			as a reflection of all of these characteristics. Often times there is some ambiguity from employers/clients about what exactly "Computational Media" is, so first I would like
			to clear the confusion and explain why it has crafted me into such an asset in the UI/UX field.

		<h2>Computational Media</h2>
		<p>
			Once I picked up a video camera it took off from there. They
			say a picture is worth a thousand words and well a video is
			worth at least a thousand pictures so I feel as though nothing
			truly captures a moment like a video does. This is my portfolio
			website where you may view my works and projects. Feel free
			to contact me if you wish to join the team.
