    <h1 id="header">"INVESTIGATION" PROJECT</h1>

    <section id="desc">
        <h2>The purpose of this project was to gain knowledge and experience in 3D
			graphic modeling practices to create an interactive experience. I worked with a team
			where I was responsible for the frontend coding as well as the level designs. As a 
			team we had to constantly think about user interaction and user experience in regard to our project.
